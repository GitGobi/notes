### **Chapter 1. Bootstrapping your Ruby literacy**

This chapter discusses basic Ruby syntax and techniques and how Ruby works, including three fundamental levels:

* Core language: design principles, syntax, and semantics
* Extensions and libraries that ship with Ruby, and the facilities for adding extensions of your own
* Command-line tools that come with Ruby, with which you run the interpreter and some other important utilities

### Basic Ruby language literacy

The examples in this book use Ruby 2.1.0. The [irb](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.0/libdoc/irb/rdoc/IRB.html) utility ships with Ruby and is the most widely used Ruby command-line tool other than the interpreter itself. The irb examples in this book will use a command-line option that makes irb output easier to read:

```shell-session
irb --simple-prompt
```
