### **Roadmap: 2016**

This page summarizes roadmaps of learning focus within the next 8 to 12 months.

### Summary

#### Fields of Interest

The interest of studies generally lies in the following fields:

* DevOps
* Operating Systems
* Networks
* System Programming

#### Proof of Concept

##### **System Programming**

* **Motive**: I'm highly interested in UNIX system programming, and have read most chapters of APUE and a few chapters of UNP, but lack hands-on programming experience.
* **Action**: I will keep reading the remaining essential chapters of APUE and UNP, and start reading LSP and TLPI, which provide more entensive and in-depth knowledge.

##### **Go and Ruby**

* **Motive**: I think that Go is a well-designed, modern language for system programming, and that Ruby is handy and commonly-used in DevOps.
* **Action**: I will read GOPL and TWGR as the stepping stones to these languages.
