### **Roadmap: 2016**

This page summarizes roadmaps of learning focus within the next 8 to 12 months.

### Summary

#### Fields of Interest

The interest of studies generally lies in the following fields:

* DevOps
* Operating Systems
* Networks
* System Programming

#### Motives and Actions

##### **Linux Kernel**

> I'm interested in Linux and it's useful to learn the internals of the Linux kernel.

I have read the majority of LKD; I need to read the rest of the chapters.

##### **System Administration**

> System administration and performance optimization is extremely relevant to my job.

I will read SPEC.

##### **System Programming**

> I'm highly interested in UNIX system programming, and have read most chapters of APUE and a few chapters of UNP, but lack hands-on programming experience.

I will keep reading the remaining major chapters of APUE and UNP, and start reading LSP and TLPI, which provide more entensive and in-depth knowledge.

##### **Go and Ruby**

> I believe that Go is a well-designed, modern language for system programming, and that Ruby is handy and commonly-used in DevOps.

I will read GOPL and TWGR as the stepping stones to these languages.

##### **C**

> C is the foundation language of the UNIX systems and is essential for kernel development and system programming.

I will read CSN to brush up concepts and learn PIC for some basic development techniques.

##### **Python**

> I have some experience with Python, but still need to learn in-depth knowledge and advanced usage.

I will read PER for extensive coverage.

##### **Networks and Security**

> I'm fairly interested in computer networks and security, but lack a lot of knowledge in the related fields, such as TCP/IP and cryptography.

For networks, I have read some chapters of TCPv1, so I need to continue reading it, along with TCPIP as a supplement and reference. To learn cryptography, I will read CNSPP.
