### Summary

#### Fields of Interest

The interest of studies generally lies in the following fields:

* DevOps
* Operating Systems
* Networks
* System Programming

#### Motives and Actions

##### **Linux Kernel**

> I'm interested in Linux and it's useful to learn the internals of the Linux kernel.

I have read the majority of LKD; I need to read the rest of the chapters, along with UTLK as a supplement and reference.

##### **System Administration**

> System administration and performance optimization are extremely relevant to my job.

I will read SPEC.

##### **System Programming**

> I'm highly interested in UNIX system programming, and have read most chapters of APUE and a few chapters of UNP, but lack hands-on experience in implementing low-level programs.

I will keep reading the remaining major chapters of APUE and UNP, and start reading LSP and TLPI, which provide more extensive and in-depth knowledge.

##### **Go and Ruby**

> I believe that Go is a well-designed, modern language for system programming, and that Ruby is handy and commonly-used in DevOps.

I will read GOPL and TWGR as the stepping stones to these languages.

##### **C**

> C is the foundation language of the UNIX systems and is essential for kernel development and system programming. I'm weak in C and lack programming experience.

I will read CSN to brush up the concepts and learn PIC for some basic development techniques.

##### **Python**

> I have some experience with Python, but still need to learn in-depth knowledge and advanced usage.

I will read PER for extensive coverage.

##### **Networks and Security**

> I'm fairly interested in computer networks and security, but lack a lot of knowledge in the related fields, such as TCP/IP and cryptography.

For networks, I have read some chapters of TCPv1, so I need to continue reading it, along with TCPIP as a supplement and reference. To learn cryptography, I will read CNSPP. To learn security techniques, I will read HTAE.

##### **System Architecture**

> Large-scale distributed systems are highly relevant to my job.

I have read the most part of DevOps. In addition to finishing with DevOps, I will read BD.

##### **Miscellanea**

> The x86 assembly language is essential for learning the Linux kernel, system programming, and security.

I will read x86 assembly and x86 disassembly.

#### Notes Methodology

1. **Systematic**: on a regular basis, read the major chapters (possibly unordered) of the entire books.
2. **Ad hoc**: read a specific chapter, section, or topic.
3. **Timer**: set a timer when reading and note-taking to ensure efficiency.

#### Pros and Cons

##### **Pros**

1. **Perseverance**: making notes guarantees long-term, persistent learning paths.
2. **Selective and readable**: well-structured, focus-highlighted notes help memorization and internalization.
3. **Available for lookups**: the notes are powerful resources for future reference.

##### **Cons**

1. **Time-consuming**: formatting texts, adding images and sorting out information takes about 1/3 of the overall time spent on learning.
2. **Tedious**: the notes can sometimes be lengthy and pointless.
