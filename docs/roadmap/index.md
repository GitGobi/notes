### Note-taking Methodology

1. **Systematic**: on a regular basis, read the major chapters (possibly unordered) of the entire books.
2. **Ad hoc**: read a specific chapter, section, or topic.
3. **Timer**: set a timer when reading and note-taking to ensure efficiency.

#### Pros and Cons

**Pros**:

1. **Perseverance**: making notes guarantees long-term, persistent learning paths.
2. **Selective and readable**: well-structured, focus-highlighted notes help memorization and internalization.
3. **Available for lookups**: the notes are powerful resources for future reference.

**Cons**:

1. **Time-consuming**: formatting texts, adding images and sorting out information takes about 1/3 of the overall time spent on learning.
2. **Tedious**: the notes can sometimes be lengthy and pointless.
