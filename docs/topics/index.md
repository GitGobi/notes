### Operating Systems and Kernel Architecture

The system architecture of UNIX and Linux involves major concepts such as kernel, operating system, system calls, library functions, and hardware resources. It is discussed in [APUE Chapter 1](../apue/ch1.md#unix-architecture), [LKD Chapter 1](../lkd/ch1.md#overview-of-operating-systems-and-kernels) and [SPEC Chapter 3](../spec/ch1.md#background).
