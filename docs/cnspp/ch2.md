#### **Part 1: Symmetric Ciphers**

### **Chapter 2. Classical Encryption Techniques**

#### Definitions of Terms *

* **Plaintext**: original message
* **Ciphertext**: coded message
* **Enciphering** or **encryption**: the process of converting from plaintext to ciphertext
* **Deciphering** or **decryption:** the process of restoring the plaintext from the ciphertext

The many schemes used for encryption constitute the area of study known as [**cryptography**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography). Such a scheme is known as a [**cryptographic system**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptosystem) (cryptosystem) or a [**cipher**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher). Techniques used for deciphering a message without any knowledge of the enciphering details fall into the area of [**cryptanalysis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis). Cryptanalysis is what the layperson calls "breaking the code". The areas of cryptography and cryptanalysis together are called **cryptology**.
