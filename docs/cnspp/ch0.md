    * Stream encryption algorithm: RC4.
    * Pseudorandom and random number generation.
2. **Asymmetric Ciphers**: public-key algorithms.
    * RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adelman).
    * Elliptic curve.
3. **Cryptographic Data Integrity Algorithms**:
    * Cryptographic hash functions.
    * Message authentication codes and digital signatures.
4. **Mutual Trust**: key management abd distribution and user authentication.
5. **Network Security and Internet Security**: cryptographic algorithms and security protocols that provide security over networks and the Internet.
    * Network access control.
    * Cloud security.
    * Transport-level security.
    * Wireless network security.
    * E-mail security.
