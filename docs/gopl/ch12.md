### **Chapter 12. Reflection**

Go provides a mechanism to do the following on variables without knowing their types at compile time:

* Update variables and inspect their values at run time
* Call their methods
* Apply the operations intrinsic to their representation

This mechanism is called [reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_(computer_programming)). Reflection also lets us treat types themselves as first-class values.

This chapter covers Go's reflection features on how they increase the expressiveness of the language, and in particular how they are crucial to the implementation of two
important APIs:

* String formatting provided by [`fmt`](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/)
* Protocol encoding provided by packages like [`encoding/json`](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/) and [`encoding/xml`](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/xml/)

Reflection is also essential to the template mechanism provided by the [`text/template`](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/) and [`html/template`](https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/) packages as seen in [Section 4.6](ch4.md#text-and-html-templates). However, reflection is complex to reason about and not for casual use, so although these packages are implemented using reflection, they do not expose reflection in their own APIs.

### Why Reflection?

Sometimes we need to write a function capable of dealing uniformly with values of types, which have one of the following traits:

* They don't satisfy a common interface,
* They don't have a known representation,
* They don't exist at the time we design the function,
* All three of above.

A familiar example is the formatting logic within `fmt.Fprintf`, which can usefully print an arbitrary value of any type, even a user-defined one. Let's try to implement a function like it using what we know already. For simplicity, our function will accept one argument and will return the result as a string like `fmt.Sprint` does, so we'll call it `Sprint`.

We start with a type switch that tests whether the argument defines a `String` method and call it if so. We then add switch cases that test the values' dynamic type against each of the basic types: `string`, `int`, `bool`, etc., and perform the appropriate formatting operation in each case.

```go
func Sprint(x interface{}) string {
	type stringer interface {
		String() string
	}
	switch x := x.(type) {
	case stringer:
		return x.String()
	case string:
		return x
	case int:
		return strconv.Itoa(x)
	// ...similar cases for int16, uint32, and so on...
	case bool:
	if x {
		return "true"
		}
		return "false"
	default:
		// array, chan, func, map, pointer, slice, struct
		return "???"
	}
}
```

But how do we deal with other types?

* Types like `[]float64`, `map[string][]string`: we can add more cases, but the number of such types is infinite.
* Named types like [`url.Values`](https://golang.org/pkg/net/url/#Values): even if the type switch had a case for its underlying type `map[string][]string`, it wouldn't match `url.Values` because the two types are not identical, and the type switch cannot include a case for each type like `url.Values` because that would require this library to depend upon its clients.

Without a way to inspect the representation of values of unknown types, we quickly get stuck.  What we need is reflection.

### `reflect.Type` and `reflect.Value`

Reflection is provided by the [`reflect`](https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/) package. It defines two important types, [`Type`](https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/#Type) and [`Value`](https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/#Value). A `Type` represents a Go type. It is an interface with many methods for discriminating among types and inspecting their components, like the fields of a struct or the parameters of a function. The sole implementation of `reflect.Type` is the type descriptor ([Section 7.5](ch7.md#interface-values)), the same entity that identifies the dynamic type of an interface value.

The [`reflect.TypeOf`](https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/#TypeOf) function accepts any `interface{}` and returns its dynamic type as a `reflect.Type`:

```go
t := reflect.TypeOf(3)  // a reflect.Type
fmt.Println(t.String()) // "int"
fmt.Println(t)          // "int"
```

The `TypeOf(3)` call above assigns the value 3 to the `interface{}` parameter. Recall from [Section 7.5](ch7.md#interface-values) that an assignment from a concrete value to an interface type performs an implicit interface conversion, which creates an interface value consisting of two components:

* Its dynamic type is the operand's type (`int`)
* Its dynamic value is the operand's value (3)

Because `reflect.TypeOf` returns an interface value's dynamic type, it always returns a concrete type. For example, the code below prints "`*os.File`", not "`io.Writer`". Later, we will see that `reflect.Type` is also capable of representing interface types.

```go
var w io.Writer = os.Stdout
fmt.Println(reflect.TypeOf(w)) // "*os.File"
```

Notice that `reflect.Type` satisfies `fmt.Stringer`. Because printing the dynamic type of an interface value is useful for debugging and logging, `fmt.Printf` provides a shorthand, `%T`, that uses `reflect.TypeOf` internally:

```go
fmt.Printf("%T\n", 3) // "int"
```

The other important type in the `reflect` package is `Value`. A `reflect.Value` can hold a value of any type. The `reflect.ValueOf` function accepts any `interface{}` and returns a `reflect.Value` containing the interface's dynamic value. As with `reflect.TypeOf`, the results of `reflect.ValueOf` are always concrete, but a `reflect.Value` can also hold interface values.

```go
v := reflect.ValueOf(3) // a reflect.Value
fmt.Println(v)          // "3"
fmt.Printf("%v\n", v)   // "3"
fmt.Println(v.String()) // NOTE: "<int Value>"
```

Like `reflect.Type`, `reflect.Value` also satisfies `fmt.Stringer`, but <u>unless the `Value` holds a string, the result of the `String` method reveals only the type. Instead, use the `fmt` package's `%v` verb, which treats `reflect.Value`s specially.</u>

Calling the [`Type`](https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/#Value.Type) method on a `Value` returns its type as a `reflect.Type`:

```go
t := v.Type()            // a reflect.Type
fmt.Println(t.String())  // "int"
```

The inverse operation to `reflect.ValueOf` is the [`reflect.Value.Interface`](https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/#Value.Interface) method. It returns an `interface{}` holding the same concrete value as the `reflect.Value`:

```go
v := reflect.ValueOf(3) // a reflect.Value
x := v.Interface()      // an interface{}
i := x.(int)            // an int
fmt.Printf("%d\n", i)   // "3"
```

A `reflect.Value` and an `interface{}` (empty interface) can both hold arbitrary values. What is the difference between them?

* An empty interface hides the representation and intrinsic operations of the value it holds and exposes none of its methods, so unless we know its dynamic type and use a type assertion to peer inside it (as we did above), there is little we can do to the value within.
* In contrast, a `Value` has many methods for inspecting its contents, regardless of its type.

Let's use the methods of a `Value` for our second attempt at a general formatting function called `format.Any`.

Instead of a type switch, we use `reflect.Value`'s `Kind` method to discriminate the cases. Although there are infinitely many types, there are only a finite number of *kinds* of type:

* The basic types `Bool`, `String`, and all the numbers
* The aggregate types `Array` and `Struct`
* The reference types `Chan`, `Func`, `Ptr`, `Slice`, and `Map`
* `Interface` types
* `Invalid`, meaning no value at all (The zero value of a `reflect.Value` has kind `Invalid`.)

<small>[gopl.io/ch12/format/format.go](https://github.com/shichao-an/gopl.io/blob/master/ch12/format/format.go)</small>

```go
package format

import (
	"reflect"
	"strconv"
)

// Any formats any value as a string.
func Any(value interface{}) string {
	return formatAtom(reflect.ValueOf(value))
}

// formatAtom formats a value without inspecting its internal structure.
func formatAtom(v reflect.Value) string {
	switch v.Kind() {
	case reflect.Invalid:
		return "invalid"
	case reflect.Int, reflect.Int8, reflect.Int16,
		reflect.Int32, reflect.Int64:
		return strconv.FormatInt(v.Int(), 10)
	case reflect.Uint, reflect.Uint8, reflect.Uint16,
		reflect.Uint32, reflect.Uint64, reflect.Uintptr:
		return strconv.FormatUint(v.Uint(), 10)
	// ...floating-point and complex cases omitted for brevity...
	case reflect.Bool:
		return strconv.FormatBool(v.Bool())
	case reflect.String:
		return strconv.Quote(v.String())
	case reflect.Chan, reflect.Func, reflect.Ptr, reflect.Slice, reflect.Map:
		return v.Type().String() + " 0x" +
			strconv.FormatUint(uint64(v.Pointer()), 16)
	default: // reflect.Array, reflect.Struct, reflect.Interface
		return v.Type().String() + " value"
	}
}
```

This function treats each value as an indivisible thing with no internal structure (hence `formatAtom`). For aggregate types (structs and arrays) and interfaces it prints only the type of the value, and for reference types (channels, functions, pointers, slices, and maps), it prints the type and the reference address in hexadecimal. This is less than ideal but still a major improvement. Since `Kind` is concerned only with the underlying representation, `format.Any` also works for named types. For example:

```go
var x int64 = 1
var d time.Duration = 1 * time.Nanosecond
fmt.Println(format.Any(x))                  // "1"
fmt.Println(format.Any(d))                  // "1"
fmt.Println(format.Any([]int64{x}))         // "[]int64 0x8202b87b0"
fmt.Println(format.Any([]time.Duration{d})) // "[]time.Duration 0x8202b87e0"
```
