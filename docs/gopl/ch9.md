### **Chapter 9. Concurrency with Shared Variables**

The previous chapter presented several programs that use goroutines and channels to
express concurrency in a direct and natural way.

This chapter looks at the mechanics of concurrency, and in particular discusses:

* Some of the problems associated with sharing variables among multiple goroutines.
* The analytical techniques for recognizing those problems.
* The patterns for solving them.
* Some of the technical differences between goroutines and operating system threads.

### Race Conditions

In a sequential program, that is, a program with only one goroutine, the steps of the program happen in the familiar execution order determined by the program logic. For instance, in a sequence of statements, the first one happens before the second one, and so on.

In a program with two or more goroutines, the steps within each goroutine happen in the familiar order, but in general we don't know whether an event *x* in one goroutine happens before an event *y* in another goroutine, or happens after it, or is simultaneous with it. When we cannot confidently say that one event *happens before* the other, then the events *x* and *y* are *concurrent*.

Consider a function that works correctly in a sequential program. That function is *concurrency-safe* if it continues to work correctly even when called concurrently (called from two or more goroutines with no additional synchronization).

This notion can be generalized to a set of collaborating functions, such as the methods and operations of a particular type. A type is concurrency-safe if all its accessible methods and operations are concurrency-safe.

We can make a program concurrency-safe without making every concrete type in that program concurrency-safe. Indeed, concurrency-safe types are the exception rather than the rule, so you should access a variable concurrently only if the documentation for its type says that this is safe. We avoid concurrent access to most variables by either of the following:

* Confining them to a single goroutine
* Maintaining a higher-level invariant of mutual exclusion

In contrast, exported package-level functions are generally expected to be concurrency-safe. Since package-level variables cannot be confined to a single goroutine, functions that modify them must enforce mutual exclusion.

There are many reasons a function might not work when called concurrently, including:

* Deadlock
* Livelock
* Resource starvation.

This chapter focuse on the most important one, the [**race condition**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition).

A race condition is a situation in which the program does not give the correct result for some interleavings of the operations of multiple goroutines. Race conditions are pernicious because they may remain latent in a program and appear infrequently, perhaps only under heavy load or when using certain compilers, platforms, or architectures. This makes them hard to reproduce and diagnose.
