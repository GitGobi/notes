### **Chapter 4. Composite Types**

This chapter discusses composite types: arrays, slices, maps, and structs.

* Arrays and structs are *aggregate* types, whose values are concatenations of other values in memory.
    * Arrays are homogeneous. The elements all have the same type.
    * Structs are heterogeneous.

    Both arrays and structs are fixed size.

* Slices and maps are dynamic data structures that grow as values are added.
