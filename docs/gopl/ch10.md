### **Chapter 10. Packages and the Go Tool**

In a program, the majority of the functions were written by others and made available for reuse through **packages**.

Go has over 100 standard packages that provide the foundations for most applications.  The Go community has published many more, and you can find a searchable index of them at [https://godoc.org](https://godoc.org/). This chapter discusses how to use existing packages and create new ones.

Go also comes with the `go` tool, a sophisticated but simple-to-use command for managing workspaces of Go packages. Since the beginning of the book, weâ€™ve been showing how to use the `go` tool to download, build, and run example programs. This chapter studies the tools' underlying concepts and its capabilities, which include printing documentation and querying metadata about the packages in the workspace.
