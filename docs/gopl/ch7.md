### **Chapter 7. Interfaces**

Interface types express generalizations or abstractions about the behaviors of other types. By generalizing, interfaces facilitate more flexible and adaptable functions because they are not tied to the details of one particular implementation.

Different from the notion of interfaces in other object-oriented languages, Go's interfaces is distinctive in that they are satisfied implicitly. In other words, there's no need to declare all the interfaces that a given concrete type satisfies; simply possessing the necessary methods is enough. With this design, you are able to create new interfaces that are satisfied by existing concrete types without changing the existing types, which is particularly useful for types defined in packages that you don't control.

This chapter discusses:

* Basic mechanics of interface types and their values
* Several important interfaces from the standard library
* Type assertions and type switches

### Interfaces as Contracts

#### Concrete type and interface type *

All the types discussed so far are [**concrete types**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)#Abstract_and_Concrete). A concrete type specifies the exact representation of its values and exposes the intrinsic operations of that representation, such as arithmetic for numbers, or indexing, `append`, and `range` for slices. A concrete type may also provide additional behaviors through its methods. When you have a value of a concrete type, you know exactly what it is and what you can do with it.

There is another kind of type in Go called an **interface type**. An interface is an [**abstract type**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_type). It doesn't expose the representation or internal structure of its values, or the set of basic operations they support; it reveals only some of their methods. When you have a value of an interface type, you know nothing about what it is; you know only what it can do, or more precisely, what behaviors are provided by its methods.

#### The `io.Writer` interface *

This book has used two similar functions for string formatting:

* `fmt.Printf`, which writes the result to the standard output (a file)
* `fmt.Sprintf`, which returns the result as a string

Thanks to interfaces, both of these functions are in effect wrappers around a third function, `fmt.Fprintf`, which is agnostic about what happens to the result it computes:

```go
package fmt

func Fprintf(w io.Writer, format string, args ...interface{}) (int, error)

func Printf(format string, args ...interface{}) (int, error) {
	return Fprintf(os.Stdout, format, args...)
}

func Sprintf(format string, args ...interface{}) string {
	var buf bytes.Buffer
	Fprintf(&buf, format, args...)
	return buf.String()
}
```

The `F` prefix of `Fprintf` stands for *file* and indicates that the formatted output should be written to the file provided as the first argument.

* In the `Printf` case, the argument, `os.Stdout`, is an [`*os.File`](https://golang.org/pkg/os/#File).
* In the `Sprintf` case, the argument is not a file but superficially resembles one: `&buf` is a pointer to a memory buffer to which bytes can be written.

The first parameter of `Fprintf` is not a file either. It's an [`io.Writer`](https://golang.org/pkg/io/#Writer), which is an interface type with the following declaration:

<small>[go/src/io/io.go](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/io/io.go)</small>

```go
package io

// Writer is the interface that wraps the basic Write method.
//
// Write writes len(p) bytes from p to the underlying data stream.
// It returns the number of bytes written from p (0 <= n <= len(p))
// and any error encountered that caused the write to stop early.
// Write must return a non-nil error if it returns n < len(p).
// Write must not modify the slice data, even temporarily.
//
// Implementations must not retain p.
type Writer interface {
	Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
```

The `io.Writer` interface defines the contract between `Fprintf` and its callers.

* The contract requires that the caller provide a value of a concrete type like `*os.File` or `*bytes.Buffer` that has a method called `Write` with the appropriate signature and behavior.
* The contract guarantees that `Fprintf` will do its job given any value that satisfies the `io.Writer` interface.
* `Fprintf` may not assume that it is writing to a file or to memory, only that it can call `Write`.

Because `fmt.Fprintf` assumes nothing about the representation of the value and relies only on the behaviors guaranteed by the `io.Writer` contract, we can safely pass a value of any concrete type that satisfies `io.Writer` as the first argument to `fmt.Fprintf`. This freedom to substitute one type for another that satisfies the same interface is called *substitutability*, and is a hallmark of object-oriented programming.

The following example uses a new type. The `Write` method of the `*ByteCounter` type below merely counts the bytes written to it before discarding them. (The conversion is required to make the types of `len(p)` and `*c` match in the `+=` assignment statement.)

<small>[gopl.io/ch7/bytecounter/main.go](https://github.com/shichao-an/gopl.io/blob/master/ch7/bytecounter/main.go)</small>

```go
type ByteCounter int

func (c *ByteCounter) Write(p []byte) (int, error) {
	*c += ByteCounter(len(p)) // convert int to ByteCounter
	return len(p), nil
}
```

Since `*ByteCounter` satisfies the `io.Writer` contract, we can pass it to `Fprintf`; the `ByteCounter` correctly accumulates the length of the result.

```go
var c ByteCounter
c.Write([]byte("hello"))
fmt.Println(c) // "5", = len("hello")

c = 0 // reset the counter
var name = "Dolly"
fmt.Fprintf(&c, "hello, %s", name)
fmt.Println(c) // "12", = len("hello, Dolly")
```

#### The `fmt.Stringer` interface *

Besides `io.Writer`, `fmt.Stringer` is another interface of great importance to the `fmt` package. `Fprintf` and `Fprintln` provide a way for types to control how their values are printed. For example:

* In [Section 2.5](ch2.md#type-declarations), we defined a `String` method for the `Celsius` type so that temperatures would print as "`100Â°C`.
* In [Section 6.5](ch6.md#example-bit-vector-type), we equipped `*IntSet` with a `String` method so that sets would be rendered using traditional set notation like "`{1 2 3}`".

Declaring a `String` method makes a type satisfy `fmt.Stringer`, which is one of the most widely used interfaces of all:

<small>[go/src/fmt/print.go](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/fmt/print.go)</small>

```go
package fmt

// The String method is used to print values passed
// as an operand to any format that accepts a string
// or to an unformatted printer such as Print.
type Stringer interface {
	String() string
}
```

[Section 7.10](#type-assertions) will explain how the `fmt` package discovers which values satisfy this interface.

### Interface Types

An interface type specifies a set of methods that a concrete type must possess to be considered an instance of that interface.

The `io.Writer` type is one of the most widely used interfaces because it provides an abstraction of all the types to which bytes can be written, such as files, memory buffers, network connections, HTTP clients, archivers and hashers. The `io` package defines many other useful interfaces. A `Reader` represents any type from which you can read bytes, and a `Closer` is any value that you can close, such as a file or a network connection. (Notice the naming convention for many of Go's single-method interfaces.)

```go
package io

type Reader interface {
	Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}

type Closer interface {
	Close() error
}
```

The following are examples of new interface types as combinations of existing ones:

```go
type ReadWriter interface {
	Reader
	Writer
}

type ReadWriteCloser interface {
	Reader
	Writer
	Closer
}
```

The syntax used above, which resembles [struct embedding](ch4#struct-embedding-and-anonymous-fields), enables us to name another interface as a shorthand for writing out all of its methods. This is called *embedding* an interface. We could have written `io.ReadWriter` without embedding like this:

```go
type ReadWriter interface {
	Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
	Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
```

We can even use a mixture of the two styles:

```go
type ReadWriter interface {
	Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
	Writer
}
```

All three declarations have the same effect. The order in which the methods appear is immaterial. All that matters is the set of methods.

### Interface Satisfaction

A type *satisfies* an interface if it possesses all the methods the interface requires. For example:

* An `*os.File` satisfies `io.Reader`, `Writer`, `Closer`, and `ReadWriter`.
* A `*bytes.Buffer` satisfies `Reader`, `Writer`, and `ReadWriter`, but does not satisfy `Closer` because it does not have a `Close` method.

As a shorthand, Go programmers often say that a concrete type "is a" particular interface type, meaning that it satisfies the interface. For example:

* A `*bytes.Buffer` is an `io.Writer`.
* An `*os.File` is an `io.ReadWriter`.

The assignability rule ([Section 2.4.2](ch2.md##assignability)) for interfaces is very simple: an expression may be assigned to an interface only if its type satisfies the interface. For example:

```go
var w io.Writer
w = os.Stdout           // OK: *os.File has Write method
w = new(bytes.Buffer)   // OK: *bytes.Buffer has Write method
w = time.Second         // compile error: time.Duration lacks Write method

var rwc io.ReadWriteCloser
rwc = os.Stdout         // OK: *os.File has Read, Write, Close methods
rwc = new(bytes.Buffer) // compile error: *bytes.Buffer lacks Close method
```

This rule applies even when the right-hand side is itself an interface:

```go
w = rwc     // OK: io.ReadWriteCloser has Write method
rwc = w     // compile error: io.Writer lacks Close method
```

We should explain one subtlety in what it means for a type to have a method. Recall from [Section 6.2](ch6.md#methods-with-a-pointer-receiver) that for each named concrete type `T`, some of its methods have a receiver of type `T` itself whereas others require a `*T` pointer. Recall also that it is legal to call a `*T` method on an argument of type `T` as long as the argument is a variable; the compiler implicitly takes its address. However, this is mere syntactic sugar: a value of type `T` does not possess all the methods that a `*T` pointer does; as a result, `T` might satisfy fewer interfaces.

For example, the `String` method of the `IntSet` type from [Section 6.5](ch6.md#example-bit-vector-type) requires a pointer receiver, so we cannot call that method on a non-addressable `IntSet` value:

```go
type IntSet struct { /* ... */ }
func (*IntSet) String() string
var _ = IntSet{}.String() // compile error: String requires *IntSet receiver
```

But we can call it on an `IntSet` variable:

```go
var s IntSet
var _ = s.String() // OK: s is a variable and &s has a String method
```

However, since only `*IntSet` has a `String` method, only `*IntSet` satisfies the `fmt.Stringer` interface:

```go
var _ fmt.Stringer = &s // OK
var _ fmt.Stringer = s  // compile error: IntSet lacks String method
```

[Section 12.8](ch12.md#displaying-the-methods-of-a-type) includes a program that prints the methods of an arbitrary value, and the `godoc -analysis=type` tool ([Section 10.7.4](ch10.md#documenting-packages)) displays the methods of each type and the relationship between interfaces and concrete types.

An interface wraps and conceals the concrete type and value that it holds. <u>Only the methods revealed by the interface type may be called, even if the concrete type has others</u>:

```go
os.Stdout.Write([]byte("hello")) // OK: *os.File has Write method
os.Stdout.Close()                // OK: *os.File has Close method

var w io.Writer
w = os.Stdout
w.Write([]byte("hello")) // OK: io.Writer has Write method
w.Close()                // compile error: io.Writer lacks Close method
```

#### Empty interface: `interface{}` *

An interface with more methods, such as `io.ReadWriter`, tells us more about the values it contains, and places greater demands on the types that implement it, than does an interface with fewer methods such as `io.Reader`. Similarly, the type `interface{}`, which has no methods at all, tell us about nothing about the concrete types that satisfy it. This may seem useless, but in fact the type `interface{}`, which is called the **empty interface** type, is indispensable. Because the empty interface type places no demands on the types that satisfy it, we can assign any value to the empty interface.

```go
var any interface{}
any = true
any = 12.34
any = "hello"
any = map[string]int{"one": 1}
any = new(bytes.Buffer)
```

The empty interface type has been used in the very first example in this book, because it is what allows functions like `fmt.Println`, or `errorf` in [Section 5.7](ch5.md#anonymous-functions), to accept arguments of any type.

Having created an `interface{}` value containing a boolean, float, string, map, pointer, or any other type, we can do nothing directly to the value it holds since the interface has no methods. We need a way to get the value back out again, which can be done using a type assertion, discussed in [Section 7.10](#type-assertions).

Since interface satisfaction depends only on the methods of the two types involved, there is no need to declare the relationship between a concrete type and the interfaces it satisfies. However, it is occasionally useful to document and assert the relationship when it is intended but not otherwise enforced by the program. The declaration below asserts at compile time that a value of type `*bytes.Buffer` satisfies `io.Writer`:

```go
// *bytes.Buffer must satisfy io.Writer
var w io.Writer = new(bytes.Buffer)
```

We needn't allocate a new variable since any value of type `*bytes.Buffer` will do, even `nil`, which we write as `(*bytes.Buffer)(nil)` using an explicit conversion. Since we never intend to refer to `w`, we can replace it with the blank identifier, which makes more frugal variant:

```go
// *bytes.Buffer must satisfy io.Writer
var _ io.Writer = (*bytes.Buffer)(nil)
```

Non-empty interface types such as `io.Writer` are most often satisfied by a pointer type, particularly when one or more of the interface methods implies some kind of mutation to the receiver, as the `Write` method does. A pointer to a struct is an especially common method-bearing type.

Pointer types are not the only types that satisfy interfaces, and even interfaces with mutator methods may be satisfied by other reference types. For example:

* Slice types with methods (`geometry.Path`, [Section 6.1](ch6.md#method-declarations))
* Map types with methods (`url.Values`, [Section 6.2.1](ch6.md#nil-is-a-valid-receiver-value)),
* Function type with methods (`http.HandlerFunc`, [Section 7.7](#the-httphandler-interface)).
* Even basic types may satisfy interfaces: in [Section 7.4](#parsing-flags-with-flagvalue), `time.Duration` satisfies `fmt.Stringer`.

A concrete type may satisfy many unrelated interfaces. For example, a program that organizes or sells digitized cultural artifacts might define the following set of concrete types:

```text
Album
Book
Movie
Magazine
Podcast
TVEpisode
Track
```

Each abstraction of interest can be expressed as an interface. Some properties are common to all artifacts, such as a title, a creation date, and a list of creators (authors or artists).

```go
type Artifact interface {
	Title() string
	Creators() []string
	Created() time.Time
}
```

Other properties are restricted to certain types of artifacts. Properties of the printed word are relevant only to books and magazines, whereas only movies and TV episodes have a screen resolution.

```go
type Text interface {
	Pages() int
	Words() int
	PageSize() int
}

type Audio interface {
	Stream() (io.ReadCloser, error)
	RunningTime() time.Duration
	Format() string // e.g., "MP3", "WAV"
}

type Video interface {
  Stream() (io.ReadCloser, error)
  RunningTime() time.Duration
  Format() string // e.g., "MP4", "WMV"
  Resolution() (x, y int)
}
```

These interfaces are not the only useful way to group related concrete types together and express the facets they share in common. We may discover other groupings later. For example, if we find we need to handle `Audio` and `Video` items in the same way, we can define a `Streamer` interface to represent their common aspects without changing any existing type declarations.

```go
type Streamer interface {
	Stream() (io.ReadCloser, error)
	RunningTime() time.Duration
	Format() string
}
```

Each grouping of concrete types based on their shared behaviors can be expressed as an interface type. Unlike class-based languages, in which the set of interfaces satisfied by a class is explicit, in Go we can define new abstractions or groupings of interest when we need them, without modifying the declaration of the concrete type. This is particularly useful when the concrete type comes from a package written by a different author. Of course, there do need to be underlying commonalities in the concrete types.

### Parsing Flags with `flag.Value`

This section discusses another standard interface, `flag.Value`, which enables us to define new notations for command-line flags. For example, the following program sleeps for a specified period of time:

<small>[gopl.io/ch7/sleep/sleep.go](https://github.com/shichao-an/gopl.io/blob/master/ch7/sleep/sleep.go)</small>

```go
var period = flag.Duration("period", 1*time.Second, "sleep period")

func main() {
	flag.Parse()
	fmt.Printf("Sleeping for %v...", *period)
	time.Sleep(*period)
	fmt.Println()
}
```

Before it goes to sleep it prints the time period. The `fmt` package calls the `time.Duration`'s `String` method to print the period in a user-friendly notation instead of [a number of nanoseconds](ch6.md#other-aspects-of-encapsulation):

```shell-session
$ go build gopl.io/ch7/sleep
$ ./sleep
Sleeping for 1s...
```

* By default, the sleep period is one second, but it can be controlled through the `-period` command-line flag.
* The `flag.Duratio` function creates a flag variable of type `time.Duration` and allows the user to specify the duration in a variety of user-friendly formats, including the same notation printed by the `String` method. This symmetry of design leads to a nice user interface.

```shell-session
$ ./sleep -period 50ms
Sleeping for 50ms...
$ ./sleep -period 2m30s
Sleeping for 2m30s...
$ ./sleep -period 1.5h
Sleeping for 1h30m0s...
$ ./sleep -period "1 day"
invalid value "1 day" for flag -period: time: invalid duration 1 day
```

It's easy to define new flag notations for our own data types. We need only define a type that satisfies the `flag.Value` interface, whose declaration is:

```go
package flag

// Value is the interface to the value stored in a flag.
type Value interface {
	String() string
	Set(string) error
}
```

* The `String` method formats the flags' value for use in command-line help messages; thus every `flag.Value` is also a `fmt.Stringer`.
* The `Set` method parses its string argument and updates the flag value. In effect, the `Set` method is the inverse of the `String` method, and it is good practice for them to use the same notation.

The following example defines a `celsiusFlag` type that allows a temperature to be specified in Celsius, or in Fahrenheit with an appropriate conversion. Notice that `celsiusFlag` embeds a `Celsius` ([Section 2.5](ch2.md#type-declarations)), thereby getting a `String` method for free. To satisfy `flag.Value`, we need only declare the Set method:

<small>[gopl.io/ch7/tempconv/tempconv.go](https://github.com/shichao-an/gopl.io/blob/master/ch7/tempconv/tempconv.go)</small>

```go
type celsiusFlag struct{ Celsius }

func (f *celsiusFlag) Set(s string) error {
	var unit string
	var value float64
	fmt.Sscanf(s, "%f%s", &value, &unit) // no error check needed
	switch unit {
	case "C", "Â°C":
		f.Celsius = Celsius(value)
		return nil
	case "F", "Â°F":
		f.Celsius = FToC(Fahrenheit(value))
		return nil
	}
	return fmt.Errorf("invalid temperature %q", s)
}
```

The call to [`fmt.Sscanf`](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#Sscanf) parses a floating-point number (`value`) and a string (`unit`) from the input `s`. Although one must usually check `Sscanf`'s error result, in this case we don't need to because if there was a problem, no switch case will match.

The `CelsiusFlag` function below wraps it all up.

```go
// CelsiusFlag defines a Celsius flag with the specified name,
// default value, and usage, and returns the address of the flag variable.
// The flag argument must have a quantity and a unit, e.g., "100C".
func CelsiusFlag(name string, value Celsius, usage string) *Celsius {
	f := celsiusFlag{value}
	flag.CommandLine.Var(&f, name, usage)
	return &f.Celsius
}
```

* To the caller, it returns a pointer to the `Celsius` field embedded within the `celsiusFlag` variable `f`. The `Celsius` field is the variable that will be updated by the `Set` method during flags processing.
* The call to `Var` adds the flag to the application's set of command-line flags, the global variable `flag.CommandLine`. Programs with complex command-line interfaces may have several variables of this type.
* <u>The call to `Var` assigns a `*celsiusFlag` argument to a `flag.Value` parameter, causing the compiler to check that `*celsiusFlag` has the necessary methods.</u> (See [Section 7.3](#interface-satisfaction))

The following program uses `CelsiusFlag`:

<small>[gopl.io/ch7/tempflag/tempflag.go](https://github.com/shichao-an/gopl.io/blob/master/ch7/tempflag/tempflag.go)</small>

```
var temp = tempconv.CelsiusFlag("temp", 20.0, "the temperature")

func main() {
	flag.Parse()
	fmt.Println(*temp)
}
```

Run this program:

```shell-session
$ go build gopl.io/ch7/tempflag
$ ./tempflag
20Â°C
$ ./tempflag -temp -18C
-18Â°C
$ ./tempflag -temp 212Â°F
100Â°C
$ ./tempflag -temp 273.15K
invalid value "273.15K" for flag -temp: invalid temperature "273.15K"
Usage of ./tempflag:
-temp value
the temperature (default 20Â°C)
$ ./tempflag -help
Usage of ./tempflag:
-temp value
the temperature (default 20Â°C)
```
